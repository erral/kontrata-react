# kontrata-react

This project is the frontend search engine to [kontrata](https://github.com/erral/kontrata) a tool to provide an easy 
way to search for contracts published at the [Basque Public Administration Public Contracts
Platform (REVASCON)](https://www.contratacion.euskadi.eus/w32-kpereva/es/y46aRevasconWar/consultaContratosC/filtro?locale=es).


## Elastic

You need to have an [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co) server with all the required contracts already indexed there. Have a look
at [kontrata-docker](https://github.com/erral/kontrata-docker) a docker-compose based repo with the elastic installation.

While I figure how to configure [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS), you may need to use a browser
extension to by-pass CORS. I use [CORS Unblock](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cors-unblock/lfhmikememgdcahcdlaciloancbhjino) for Chrome.

## Work In Progress

This is a Work In Progress. I am not proficient neither in React nor in JavaScript/TypeScript. This has been mainly a copy-and-paste
based development.

PRs will be welcomed.

When I have something relevant, I may publish it in a website.

## Available Scripts

Install the dependencies, you can run:

### `yarn`

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
